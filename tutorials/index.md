These guides should help you getting started with Bookshelf quickly. For now there's not a lot of information, because
there wasn't a specific section of the documentation dedicated to guides/tutorials until recently, but we hope to begin
adding more guides to make it easier for newcomers to discover as much of the general functionality of Bookshelf as
possible.

You can contribute to these documents by editing or creating files in the `tutorials` directory.
